# Why aah framework?

There are several minimalist Go frameworks out there, each with their own set of goals. `aah`, however, is not a minimalist framework. It provides features and capabilities to build scalable, secure modern Web applications and RESTful APIs.

aah has been designed to:

  * Facilitate rapid web development
  * Be highly configurable
  * Maintain a very small memory footprint
  * Put security first
  * Achieve the greatest possible performance
  * Maintainable as application grow

...and so much more! You can read about the other features in aah by [clicking here](/features.html), or dive right into aah [technical documentation]({{aah_docs_domain_url}}).
